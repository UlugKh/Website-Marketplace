# 📄 Project Documentation  

## 📅 2025-02-19  

### ✅ Progress Today  
- **Set up branches** for each member to work in.  
- **Explained project requirements, nearing deadline, and responsibilities** to teammates.  
- Provided **instructions on how to get started and contribute**.  
- **Reminded teammates** about daily commits in Telegram.  
- **Briefed teammates in person** at university.
- **Frontend** has been created and is in development.

### ❌ Issues & Concerns  
- **No commits or communication** from most teammates on Telegram or GitHub.  
- **Only frontend** has made a meaningfull commit.
- **Reminder sent** to all members urging them to complete their tasks.  

### 🎯 Next Steps  
- **Directly contact each member** if inactivity continues.  
- **As a last resort**, if no action is taken after communication efforts, complete missing work myself and report to the professor.  

## 🛑 Project Delays  
- The project started late due to a **misunderstanding of the deadline** (thought we had until early March).  
- **Team formation and role assignment** took longer than expected as we ensured fair distribution.  
- **Plan to make up for lost time**: Work harder this week with better communication & efficiency.  

## 🔨 Structural Changes  
- **Created project structure** with dedicated branches for each member.  
- **Implemented a system** where I will check and merge branches at the end of each day.
